Here I'm outlining a bioinformatics workflow that mainly uses the keyboard to enter commands, the wide variety of tools available at the command line, storing data in easily editable text files. These tools make analysis faster because typing into the command line is faster than clicking buttons and selecting menus in a graphical interface. A string of text commands is also easier to reproduce and automate than remembering which order graphical buttons were pushed.

### The Keyboard

The best reason for using the keyboard is that it's faster than the mouse. As a general rule I think anyone can type a series of commands to perform an action faster than doing the same action with a mouse. Furthermore the more you can use the keyboard for the less your "working flow" is broken by reaching for the mouse to change to a different graphical window or to save the current document. Finally you can get faster and typing, but does anyone get faster at using the mouse?

### The Command Line

The command gives predictable and reproducible results unlike the graphical tools which require clicking buttons and manipulating fields. A simple workflow in the command line is easier for someone else to understand than a list screenshots of which buttons and menu items to cluck. 

A Unix type operating system has wide variety of tools for interacting with the operating system as well as manipulating directories and files. Many bioinformatics applications also come with versions to be run at the command line. The benefit of the command line is that the output of one command can be entered as the input of another command. Sequences of simple commands can combined together to perform more complex bioinformatics analysis. Since these tasks do not require a user with a mouse they can be performed simultaneously across multiple machines or scheduled to be performed overnight.

### Text Files

Command line tools often focus on manipulating the same type of data: simple text files with limited formatting. Often the case is where each line represents a single data entry and the file can therefore be easily manipulated line by line to search for or change specific items. Combining the command line with text files makes it relatively simple to large scale searches across many files.
