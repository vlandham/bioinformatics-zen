The aim of this website is to describe best practices in the scientific field of bioinformatics. The methods and practices presented here are those that I have been taught during my continuing career. I am grateful to the teachers, collegues and friends who have discussed the right way to do bioinformatics.

### me

I'm Michael Barton. I almost failed a degree course in wet-lab biology and therefore getting a job in science was difficult. Instead I took a masters's degree in bioinformatics and now have been more successful. I have a [blog][blog] where I write about my own research.
