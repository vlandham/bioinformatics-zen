### About

LaTeX (pronounced lay-tek) is a document creation language aimed at scientific and technical documents. LaTeX documents are written in plain text with included markup to describe which parts should be sections tables and pictures. The LaTeX system parses the markup and formats the text to produce dvi, postscript or pdf output. As LaTeX is entirely text based, the content can be tracked using a version control system. Plain text files are also editable using vim and Emacs, and can also be manipulated using Unix tools. The syntax of LaTeX markup will take an hour or two of practice to learn, but the advantage of creating documents from a marked up source is that the results are consistent and reproducible, which isn't always the case for graphical text editors.

### Features

The main reason for using LaTeX is that it allows you to work on the content of the document, not the formatting. Using a graphical editor you format the text as type, but with LaTeX you only have to add the markup to the document and LaTeX takes care of the rest. This can save a lot of time with large documents. The basic features of LaTeX include automatic generation of tables of contents, tables of figures and automatic numbering of sections tables and figures. BibTeX is the companion to LaTeX which adds organisation and easy addition of citations. Citation are added to documents using a simple "cite" command in the text, without the requirement for third party software. Finally LaTeX documents benefit from the best practices in typography and document presentation.

### Templates and Plugins

LaTeX is free and available for most operating systems. There is also a large LaTeX community which develops themes and modules that can be added to LaTeX documents. Many journals also provide LaTeX templates in which papers can be submitted. There are also great templates available for writing a [thesis or dissertation][thesis]. There may also be specific templates which follow your own institution guidelines. There are many useful third party plugins for adding extras to a document. For example there are plugins for [beautiful formating of tables][table], [grouping figures into related subfigures][subfig], [replacing text inside figures][replace] and even [a framework for including R-code inside a LaTeX document][sweave].
