Suggestions to Bioinformatics Zen are welcome and gratefully received. The single requirement is that any contributions you make become part of bioinformatics zen to be distributed freely under a [Creative Commons][cc] license. Any contributions are automatically acknowledged on the site.

The easiest way to make a contribution is to sign up for a free [Github][gh] account, and then fork the [Bioinformatics Zen content repository][content].
