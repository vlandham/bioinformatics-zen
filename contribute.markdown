Suggestions to Bioinformatics Zen are welcome and gratefully received. The single requirement is that any contributions you make become part of Bioinformatics Zen to be distributed freely under a [Creative Commons license][cc]. Any contributions are automatically acknowledged on the site.

The easiest way to make a contribution is to sign up for a free [Github][gh] account, and fork the [Bioinformatics Zen content repository][content]. You can make any edits using the online Github editor, which should be written in the simple [markdown syntax][markdown]. Once you make your changes click the "Pull Request" button and I'll be notified of your contribution.

If you feel adventurous or prefer not to use GitHub, contributions will be accepted from any publicly accessible git repository. Please keep commits to one change per file for the purposes of cherry picking and draft management.
